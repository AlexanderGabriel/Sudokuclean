# Sudokuclean

I had a bet running with a friend many years ago.
She showed me the first sudoku i saw. After a few minutes, i said, it is not so difficulty to write a program to solve that riddles.
Because she did not believe me, we bet for a box of beer if i can do this in 2 weeks or not.
A few hours later, i was a box of beer richer :)

Not sure, when this exaclty was. Somewhen between 2000 and 2007.

For everyone, interrested, in how i did this, here is my (not beautiful) code.
I cleaned up a little bit, get smarty with composer now because i can.
I also changed method of the form to GET and added a flag ?API=1 to give back json. This should enable usage from any other program :)

Have Fun, reading.
